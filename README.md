🌦️ Dynamic Weather Dashboard

A simple web app that shows real-time weather based on the user’s live location.
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it uses the Geolocation API to detect your location and the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch:

✅ Current temperature, condition, and feels-like
✅ Weather icons for quick understanding
✅ 5-day forecast with daily updates
✅ Refresh button to reload live weather

⚙️ How It Works

The browser asks for your location.

Once allowed, it fetches your latitude & longitude.

OpenWeatherMap API gives back the weather data.

The dashboard displays it in a clean, simple UI.
